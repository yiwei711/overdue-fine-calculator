This is an easy-to-use calculator that calculates overdue fine. 

I wrote it for my mom, who is an accountant, to help her with her work. 
I used Python library tkinter, which is the most popular GUI package. And I designed the user interface and functions based on my mom's needs. Because she continuously gives me new feedbacks and new functional requests, I will update many versions and therefore make this calcultor more powerful. I am glad that she and her colleague friends love it.

To use or edit this calculator for your needs, choose either way:
1. download the single 'concise\t mmdd.py' file and execute it using Python3.
2. download the above file as well as 'setup.py', put them in the same folder --> run 'setup.py' using Python3 --> you will get an executable file --> drag it onto your desktop and it will function like general app.
